# Task Overview - WhatsApp Agent System

This document provides an overview of all tasks needed to implement the WhatsApp Agent System as described in the PRD.

## Core Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Every task includes tests that must pass before moving to the next task
2. **UV for Python**: All Python dependencies managed with UV
3. **CI/CD First**: GitHub Actions must pass for every task before proceeding
4. **Incremental Progress**: Each task produces working, tested code

## Task Categories

### 1. Project Setup & Scaffolding
- 01-project-setup.md - Initialize project with UV, tests, and CI/CD

### 2. Backend Implementation (Python FastAPI)
- 02-backend-structure.md - Core backend structure with tests
- 03-backend-models.md - Database models and schemas with tests
- 04-backend-adapters.md - External service adapters with tests
- 05-backend-services.md - Business logic services with tests
- 06-backend-api.md - API endpoints with tests
- 07-backend-auth.md - Authentication implementation with tests

### 3. Frontend Implementation (Vue.js)
- 08-frontend-structure.md - Vue.js setup with tests
- 09-frontend-auth.md - Login flow with tests
- 10-frontend-sessions.md - Session management UI with tests
- 11-frontend-chat.md - Chat interface with tests
- 12-frontend-commands.md - Agent commands UI with tests

### 4. WhatsApp Bridge Integration
- 13-whatsapp-bridge.md - Zapw integration with tests
- 14-webhook-integration.md - Webhook handling with tests

### 5. OpenAI Integration
- 15-openai-integration.md - LLM integration with tests
- 16-agent-memory.md - Vector store with tests

### 6. Infrastructure & DevOps
- 17-docker-setup.md - Docker configuration with tests
- 18-database-setup.md - PostgreSQL migrations with tests
- 19-redis-setup.md - Redis/queue setup with tests

### 7. Integration Testing
- 20-integration-tests.md - End-to-end tests
- 21-load-testing.md - Performance tests

### 8. Documentation & Deployment
- 22-api-documentation.md - OpenAPI docs
- 23-deployment-guide.md - Production deployment

## Implementation Order

1. **Foundation** (Tasks 01-02): Project setup, CI/CD, basic backend
2. **Data Layer** (Task 03): Models and database schema
3. **Backend Core** (Tasks 04-07): Services, adapters, API, auth
4. **External Integrations** (Tasks 13-16): WhatsApp, OpenAI
5. **Frontend** (Tasks 08-12): UI implementation
6. **Infrastructure** (Tasks 17-19): Docker, database, Redis
7. **Quality** (Tasks 20-21): Integration and load tests
8. **Release** (Tasks 22-23): Documentation and deployment

## Testing Requirements

Each task must include:
1. Unit tests for all new code
2. Tests must pass locally before committing
3. Tests must pass in GitHub Actions before proceeding
4. Minimum 80% code coverage for each module
5. Integration tests where components interact

## Success Metrics

- All tests passing in CI/CD
- Code coverage above 80%
- No linting errors
- Working application at each stage
