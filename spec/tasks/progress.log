### In Progress
- [ ] Task 05: Private Service Structure - Major refactor to entrypoint structure

## 2025-05-26

### Architecture Refactor
- User clarified that private and public are NOT separate services but two entrypoints of the same backend project
- This is a single FastAPI project with two entry points accessed via private_main.py and public_main.py
- Updating all task specifications to reflect this correct architecture

### Completed Today
- [x] Task 03: Core Configuration and Settings - Updated to single backend with entrypoints
- [x] Task 04: Database Migrations - Updated paths from shared/ to backend/app/
- [x] Task 05: Private Entrypoint Structure - Refactored to backend/app/private structure
- [x] Task 12: Public Auth Flow - Updated for public entrypoint and added public_main.py
- [x] Task 16: Integration Testing - Updated all test paths and service references

### Architecture Refactor Summary
Successfully updated all high-priority task specifications to reflect the correct architecture:
- Single backend project with two FastAPI entrypoints (private_main.py and public_main.py)
- Shared codebase in backend/app/ with submodules for private and public APIs
- Configuration split into base, private, and public settings
- Database and core utilities shared between entrypoints
- Test structure organized by unit/integration/e2e tests

### Remaining Tasks to Update
The following medium-priority tasks still need updating for the new architecture:
- Task 07: LLM Adapter Interface
- Task 08: Message Service
- Task 09: Agent Service  
- Task 10: Admin API Endpoints
- Task 11: Webhook Handlers
- Task 13: WhatsApp Integration

Frontend tasks (14-15) may not need significant changes as they remain separate projects.
- [ ] Create/update tasks for Zapa Public service
- [ ] Update database schema tasks for new message storage strategy
- [ ] Update authentication tasks for WhatsApp-based auth
- [ ] Create remaining task specifications

- Private service handles webhooks and admin functions (not exposed to internet)
- Public service handles user authentication and data viewing
- WhatsApp-based authentication using codes sent from main number
- Efficient message storage - no large objects, only metadata for media
- Frontend uses Vue.js + Tailwind CSS
